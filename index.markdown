title: Write Yourself a Scheme in Scala

# Welcome to Write Yourself a Scheme in Scala

This is a translation to Scala of the tutorial <em>Write Yourself a Scheme in 48
Hours</em> by Jonathan Tang.

Tutorials for programming languages often use the language-reference-manual
approach to teaching. They show you the syntax of the language, a few language
constructs, and then have you construct a few simple functions at the
interactive prompt. The "hard stuff" of how to write a functioning, useful
program is left to the end, or sometimes omitted entirely.

This tutorial takes a different tack. You'll start off with command-line
arguments and parsing, and progress to writing a fully-functional Scheme
interpreter that implements a good-sized subset of [R5RS
Scheme](http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/). Along the way,
you'll learn ...

The main audience targeted by this tutorial is people who already know a
programming language of the Java/C# family and want to learn Scala and are also
interested in Lisp or Scheme. It might also be interesting for Haskell
programmers who know the original tutorial for Haskell and want to see how Scala
solves the same problems.

This tutorial will not cover the whole Scala programming language, we
specifically avoid all imperative language features and try to stay close to the
Haskell original.

Since each lesson builds on the code written for the previous one, it's probably
best to go through the lessons in order.
